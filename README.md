## CHALLENGE

Figure out how to do continuous integration with elixir projects.

Would like a build system that will pull the latest nirvana (but use any
elixir project right now), build it, run tests, and then for special bonus
points, email the results. 

Basically something to facillitate continuous integration.

Ideally it has a webhook that will plug into github

This project could be as simple as figuring out (And documenting!) how to do
this with TravisCI.  CircleCI or Wercker can work.  Any CI system.  Would
like to stay away from Jenkins or anytthing too heavy weight or complicated
to set up. 

I've been told that http://codeship.com is a good choice.  (But not specifically about using it for elixir.)
